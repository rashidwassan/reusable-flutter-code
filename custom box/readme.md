# Custom Container

## Made By https://github.com/Umar-Waseem

This folder contains a custom container.
This custom container helps you with the hassle of making nested widgets.
For example: If you want to apply border, just use the `border` property, if you want to give it some width, just use `borderWidth property`.

- Uncomment the code and use it in a Flutter project.

- `main.dart` contains an examples of the custom widgets.
- I will be making this better with better use of Object Oriented Practices.
- I will be making custom classes for more widgets where you dont have to go through any hassle, e.g: If you want a bigger text, just apply size property and boom, you have a bigger text, no need to write text style.
